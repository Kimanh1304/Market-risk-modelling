Plotting the Results of the Historical Returns

The historical method for calculating Value at Risk (VaR) provides a simple and intuitive way to estimate the potential losses in your investment portfolio. However, it is essential to remember that historical returns do not guarantee future performance, and relying solely on this method may lead to inaccurate risk assessments.

Plot the Distribution of Portfolio Returns and Parametric VaR Estimates

Calculating Value at Risk (VaR) using the parametric method can provide you with a useful metric for understanding and managing the potential risks associated with your investment portfolio. By incorporating this approach into your analysis, you can better anticipate potential losses and make more informed decisions about your investments. However, always remember that the underlying assumptions of this method, such as the normal distribution of portfolio returns, may not always be valid.
